  This book was my first attempt to curate my poetry. After rummaging through
  coffee-stained notebooks, wilting tissues, and my little red diary; I picked
  out 46 poems. NotionPress decided to make it a book and I decided to call it
  'From A Verse-Maker's Diary'. You can have a sneak peek below. If you like
  what you see, be sure to get yourself a copy!
